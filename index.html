          <h3>Amie H.</h3>
          <q>I have been doing business with Spa Tec for over 10 years and have always been happy with the quality of work and professional service. Thanks to the expertise of Jeff at Spa Tec, I was able to extend the life of my first hot tub to almost 20 years. Since purchasing a new hot tub from a reputable brand, I have been disappointed by the support I received from the manufacturer so I have turned back to Spa Tec. When I call Spa Tec I am confident that the solution recommended will be the best one to solve the problem at hand, any replacement parts will be a high quality with a reasonable warranty, and the service will be prompt so I can get back in the hot tub as soon as possible. Thank you Spa Tec.</q>

          <h3>Valerie E.</h3>
          <q>We have an ancient hot tub that was given to us by friends. It was at least 10-15 years old when we received it. This winter marks the 20th year that WE'VE used it--thanks in a large part to Spe Tec. Initially Jeff helped nurse it along as we decided whether or not we even wanted a hot tub. Now we can't imagine life without it, and he has improved it greatly for us.  He never pushes products on us, but has made suggestions that he thinks we might appreciate. He's always right! We can count on him for fast, dependable, friendly, and professional service. We trust his judgement, his prices are fair--especially given his level of expertise--and we couldn't recommend him more highly!</q>

          <h3>Ted P.</h3>
          <q>We had just about given up on finding assistance with getting our SoftHeat Sauna back to an operational state. Fortunately, we searched and found Spa Tec. An informational email was sent on a Saturday afternoon; we received a response from Jeff later that day. After further exploration, we decided to purchase the replacement parts kit. We had it in hand within 3 days. Subsequently, within an hour, it was installed and we once more are enjoying our heated sauna. I give Jeff, the installation process, and responses to my inquiries all top marks. I highly recommend this company for providing SoftHeat Sauna services.</q>

          <h3>Carole G.</h3>
          <q>Was very grateful that they agreed to a contract with Canadian Spa Company Inc. This was my very first need for an actual tech visit on my swim spa. Once there was parts ordered and he knew what to do the service was fast and efficient. The general knowledge he shared about Home Remedy mixtures for cleaning was very helpful. I pray nothing goes wrong with my spa again but if it does I will have confidence in the service I will receive.</q>

          <h3>Sandy D.</h3>
          <q>We have used Jeff, owner of Spa Tec for years. I know that he not only understands how to best repair all types of spas but he understands water quality. We purchased an ozonator from him and have never been happier with our ability to keep our water so clean with no chemicals. He always calls back with within 24 hours, mostly sooner and never leaves a mess. He has been servicing our same spa for almost 30 years. Trust me he knows what he is doing and won't try to sell you something you don't need. I would highly recommend him to anyone.</q>
        </li>

          <h3>Jason D.</h3>
          <q>My experience was great. I would recommend Spa Tec to anyone needing hot tub repair or service. My call was returned promptly. I received a confirmation call on the day of my appointment. Tech was on-time, and very professional. He told me what needed to be done along with the cost. Work was performed quickly and price quoted was honored. Area was clean when he left. It was like he was never there, except my hot tub works again. Thanks Spa Tec!</q>
